NAME
    RDF::RDFa::Parser::Trine - Use a RDF::Trine::Model for the returned RDF
    graph

VERSION
    Version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
    This module inherits all the methods of its superclass, but overrides
    the graph method, and will instead return an RDF::Trine::Model.

      $storage = RDF::Trine::Store::DBI->temporary_store;
      $parser = RDF::RDFa::Parser::Trine->new($storage, $xhtml, 'http://example.com/foo');
      $parser->consume;
      my $graph = $parser->graph;

METHODS
    $p = RDF::RDFa::Parser::Trine->new($store, $xhtml, $baseuri)
        The constructor. Has three parameters. The first is a (single)
        RDF::Trine::Store. The others are passed directly to the superclass.

    $p->graph
        Will return an RDF::Trine::Model object containing the full graph.
        As per the RDFa specification, it will always return an unnamed
        graph containing all the triples of the RDFa document.
